# Chapter 1 : A Journey to the land of Gophers

When Go became a somehow famous language among programmers, I asked myself _Why should I learn it?_. I still ask this, but for now I have some strong answers and the strongest one is that _it helps me find a job easier_. Let's get more realistic about the language and its properties. 

Go, has everything you need at the same time. Primarily it was created to become an alternative to C (but I doubt the whole idea, as most of system programs are still being written in C or C++, and also Rust has been born in pretty much the same time as Go. ) but shortly, Go became a replacement for _every single backend language_. Isn't it beautiful? 

Personally, looked for a way to write a whole new operating system in Go. In [this wiki](https://osdev.org) I found some _bare bones_ and to be honest I even couldn't compile the codes (in my defense though, I was only 16 when I was doing that and I didn't know S*it about Go). After that, one of my friends just made [this](https://github.com/fzerorubigd/tmass) which is a tmux-like tool with Go and I wanted to learn Go, again! Years passed, I just learned how Go works and how does its syntax look like, but never tried to code _seriously_ in that language. I never tried to make a _microservice_ using Go, never tried to make a simple shell or something like that. 

Everything was fine, until I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fi7uSYlOdc). I don't know are you like me or not, but if you're like me, you obviously like to make everything yourself. I always wanted to understand how docker, lxc or any other containerization system works. I personally thought _there's no better way than implementing one myself!_ and of course this idea always worked. For example, I made an operating system kernel when I was 21, just to understand how it works. Or even earlier in my teenage years, I was almost 16, I made an Ubuntu based linux distribution just to understand how Linux distributions are made and how they work. When I watched the video, I realized how cool is Docker, and also, how cool is Go! It was almost a year ago. And then, I had first sparks in my head for seriously learning Go!

Fine, I told you a story just in four paragraphs, and I'm not going to continue, because this is not a work of fiction. This book is going to help you guys migrate from Ruby to Go. So, the rest of the chapter, although it's going to be storytelling, I try to keep it as technical as I can.
