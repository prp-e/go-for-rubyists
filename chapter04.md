# Chapter 4 : FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz, is a commonly asked programming question. It doesn't matter if it's a simple programming class exam or a coding interview in a big corporate. It's simple, but needs a lot of focus and attention. In this chapter, I write it in ruby, then we try to re-write it in Go. So, why should we do this, when we don't know shit about Go? because we're going to learn different parts of a Go application in a _real world_ application and not useless examples. If you want a lot of useless examples, you can just search over the web, and you'll witness how many times people repeated pretty much the same thing, over and over again! 

Fine, instead of being angry, let's do our job. First, we need to know what is FizzBuzz (I assume you know, but I also explain it here.) After that, We will see how we can implement the algorithm in Ruby, and then we re-write that in Go.
