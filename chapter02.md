# Chapter 2 : Setting up the environment

So now we're going to set our environment up. There are so many different ways to set up a Ruby environment, right? I personally use [RVM](http://rvm.io) but there are more ways such as `rbenv` or even installing ruby from repositories (in case you use Linux) or installing from `brew` (If you have a Mac) and something like that. In this chapter, I just refer to `rvm` and do not use any other Ruby installation system. The Only reason for this is that I just want to show you differences and show you how to _not_ get confused while working with Go.
