# Chapter 5 : Functions

In the [Chapter 3](chapter03.md) I told you that I planned to discuss functions in a different chapter, right? This is it. First of all, I have to say, writing a function in a language like _C_ or _Go_ is a bit difficult. Why? Because you need to difine pretty much everything you want as the input and the output. You'll find out what I say later. In the other hand, this way of writing and declaring functions has something people like to call _type_ safety. I have examples of when Ruby can go mad when you do not provide type safety. 

Does this mean Ruby is bad? of course not. Ruby is the definition of the word love for me, but let's be honest, something like type safety is much easier to achieve in Go.

In this chapter, we'll write two simple functions both in Ruby and Go. Then we run the code. In this chapter, you really experience writing codes which are similar to the real world applications!
