# Chapter 3 : Flashback to Ruby

In the last section of the previous chapter, I've mentioned that in this chapter, we just review our knowledge of Ruby programming. I don't think it takes so long, specially if you're a rubyist or you have ideas about Ruby. You also may use this chapter as a _quick tutorial_ of Ruby, specially if you have experience in programming and your primary language is not ruby. 

As I mentioned before, Ruby is a little bit too easy to understand, so this chapter obviously is a bunch of long and boring codes. But, in the next chapter we'll see all of them in Go! So, why not just get bored before we see the true magic?
